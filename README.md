This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can run the following command to make sure all the tests run correctly.

```bash
yarn test

yarn test --coverage

```

While running the coverage test will show the coverage folder where we can see the coverage percentage of both components and utility functions
